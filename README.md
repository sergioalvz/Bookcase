This project was motivated for several reasons:

* Develop an application that satisfies my requirements for managing my personal bookase.

## Highlights

This application is able to:

* Add the user's read books
* Add the user's pending books
* Rate the user's read books
* Manage the user's loans ( **not fully implemented** ).
